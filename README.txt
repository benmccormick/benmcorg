## benmccormick.org blog theme

This is the wordpress theme I created for my personal blog.  It is currently fairly hardcoded to my personal needs, but I hope to extend it in the future to appeal to a broader audience.  It was built using the Bones framework by Eddie Machado (http://themble.com/bones/) as a base.
