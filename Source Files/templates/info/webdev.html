		<h4>Can you build my web application/business website/blog?</h4>
		<p>I am currently employed fulltime, but if you are interested in my work and have a flexible schedule, I am happy to build a site for you.  

		If you have an immediate need, I would suggest a professional solution, but I can advise on an approach and point you toward resources.</p>



		<h4>How much do you charge to build a website?</h4>



		<p>My freelance projects are intended for me to gain experience and to help out friends, so I do not charge for them.  If you're satisfied with the work I do for you, you can feel free to make a donation.  Any donation money will go towards software and equipment for future web projects. However, there are costs associated with owning and maintaining a website, and I would expect these to be covered by you.</p>



		<h4>What are the costs to having a website?</h4>



		<p>To maintain a website you need a domain name and a host.  The domain name is the address people use to find your site, such as "benmccormick.org" or "google.com".  The host is where your website information is stored and broadcasted out to the internet.  You can register for a domain name online from registrars like <a href="http://www.1and1.com/">1&amp;1</a> and <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>.  Depending on the domain and registrar you choose, costs can range from between $2 and $20 a year for a domain name.  Hosting is provided by a variety of different sites including <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost</a> and <a href="www.hostgator.com">HostGator</a>.  Hosting usually costs approximately $5/month for a typical personal or small business site.  Those costs can go up if you require extra options like guaranteed uptime or extra high bandwidth.  </p>



		<p>In addition to hosting and domain names, there may be extra upfront costs if you want to use a professionally created components for your site such as high resolution stock photography, a professionally designed theme, or e-commerce services. I will expect you to cover all of these costs and can work with you to find something that meets your needs and budget.  If you require it, I can provide ongoing service and/or manage your domain name &amp; hosting.  I would ask for a consistent monthly payment in this case.    </p>



		<h4>What should I expect when I ask you to build my website?</h4>



		<p>We'll go through the following process.</p>



		<ol>

			<li>Meet - We'll have an initial meeting.  This may be by phone, email or in person, but we'll talk about what you're hoping to get out of the website, who your target audience is, as well as the logistics of timeframe and budget.</li>

			<li>Design - I'll come back to you with a potential design for your website, which you can approve or tweak.</li>

			<li>Construction- I'll build your website to the design you approved, and test it in all major browsers.</li>

			<li>Deploy - The website will go public!</li>

			<li>Maintain - If you wish, we can work out a plan for me to help maintain the site.</li>

		</ol>



		<h4>If I make a donation, what will it be used for?</h4>



		<p>I'm putting all donations I receive for web development work towards software and hardware to help me do a better job on future web projects.  Some items I hope to purchase with these funds include:</p>
		<ol>

			<li><del>Sublime Text 2 ($59) - a text editor for writing code</del></li>

			<li><del>Sublime SFTP ($16) - Software to transfer web pages to a server</del</li>

			<li>Adobe Design Standard ($210) - Graphic design software</li>

			<li>Laptop ($1000-$2200) - allow me to edit web sites on the go</li>

			<li>Professional Fonts &amp; Themes (various)- Professionally designed elements to enhance future websites</li>

		</ol>
